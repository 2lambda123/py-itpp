## py-itpp
Python wrapper library for signal processing and communications research.

## Description
py-itpp is a set of Python wrappers over the open source IT++ library (which is written in C++). The wrappers use Boost.Python extensively and compile to a shared library that can be imported into Python. The py-itpp data structures can be easily converted to Numpy ndarrays for further processing and plotting. In addition to fast prototyping for signal processing and communications research, py-itpp is motivated by research into machine learning for communication systems.
